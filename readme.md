# Graphical python toll for database management

This tool for DB management simulates a MySQL-like structure, with tables beeing loaded into RAM for queries to be processed.

## How to use it

Simply run:

```terminal
python3 main.py
```

on your terminal, and a load screen will pop up. Choose the desired folder with _.csv_ files in it, and then click **Load**.

All .csv files will be loaded into memory as tables, and you can start to write your queries.

### Query sintax

The sintax is simpler than the MySQL one. It's separator is a **blank space**.

To write correctly simply **put a blank space btween all words and sybols** and then **put a ; in the end**. Any other syntax will cause problems. Press ENTER to run.

**Query example**

```terminal
select id birth_date first_name from employees where first_name = John and id > 50397 order by birth_date;
```
